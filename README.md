twoPrompt uses the python command line to make prompting different LLMs easier

the command line has a free guest version that anyone can use (but limited usage, 20 free prompt) and a paid version that you login to and pay as you go (0.02 dollars per prompt or 2 dollars per 100 prompt)

twoPrompt allows you choose and prompt different LLMs in the same place.
