# twoLLM
twoLLM is a multiple LLM prompter that allows you to prompt different LLMs in the same chatbot.

twoLLM uses the python command line to make prompting different LLMs easier, it doesn't have a website except its login page (so you can login to the paid version).

the command line has a free guest version that anyone can use (but limited usage per day) and a paid version that you login to and pay as you go (20 cents per 100 prompts)

twoLLM allows you choose and prompt different LLMs in the same place.
